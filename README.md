# SpamTestNormandy
Created by Karolina Groszewska. Used as a phising/spam email quiz to help company employees discern spam mail from legitimate mail. Some resources are pulled from popular spam mail sites, others were pulled from Normandy employees' emails.

The front end is based off the UrbanInstitute QuickQuiz template, with some professionalism and aesthetic changes being made. The quiz questions are populated using JSON, but there's a bunch of js/css/html and python doing the work behind the scenes.
